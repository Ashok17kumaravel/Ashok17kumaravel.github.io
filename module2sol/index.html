  		<p class="content-name name1">TWITTER</p>
  		<p class="content">Twitter, a social networking site launched in 2006, is undoubtedly one of the most popular social media platforms available today, with 100 million daily active users and 500 million tweets sent daily.Twitter can be used to receive news, follow high-profile celebrities, or stay in-touch with old high school friends.
            
            But its popularity can be intimidating -- if you don't know how to use Twitter in 2019, should you even bother trying to join the masses who've acquired years of experience on the site?

   		<p class="content">In my personal experience, Instagram is a lightweight platform which puts the focus on images and doesn't attempt to be the end-all, be-all social network which (ironically, it's parent) Facebook is. From a professional marketing standpoint, Instagram offers companies in both B2B and B2C realms a unique opportunity to diversify the ways in which prospects, leads, and customers conceptualize their brand.

            Today, I'd like to take a quick stroll through Instagram's photo and video features.</p>

  		<p class="content-name name3">FB</p>
  		<p class="content">Established in 2004, from the college dorm room of Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard student, the website is now worth billions of dollars and is one of the world’s most recognisable brands. It’s even had the Hollywood treatment, with The Social Network, a film exploring the site’s conception, released to wide acclaim in 2011. But, if you’re not quite on top of technology or are new to the internet, as a parent, or a teacher, you probably have a few questions.</p>
